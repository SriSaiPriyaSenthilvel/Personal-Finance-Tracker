# 💰 Personal Finance Tracker

A responsive, browser-based web application to manage income and expenses, track balances, and visualize spending patterns — built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
I developed the **Personal Finance Tracker** to help users log financial transactions, view real-time summaries, and analyze their budget through charts — all without a backend.  
The app uses the **LocalStorage API** to save data directly in the browser, making it lightweight, fast, and accessible offline.
